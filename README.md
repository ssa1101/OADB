This Data Scrubber Application utilizes a React frontend and a Flask backend. User's are able to submit their credentials in the MaterialUI text field and click the button "Add User" to have their data submitted to a SQLAlchemy database. Using REST API principles, this application assigns each user a unique ID. Users can also clear the table (thus clearing the database), copy the information in the textfield to their clipboard, and clear the text in the textfield. 

This rudimentary application is intended to demonstrate my understanding of Flask, database management, frontend design, and REST architecture. To get personal data submitted properly, make sure to enter all data separated with commas (not including an ID number). Thus, a valid entry would be Shifa, Sadaat, 2022-11-01, 19, shifasadaat@gmail.com.
